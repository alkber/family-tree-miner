# family-tree-miner
Our story is set in the planet of Lengaburu......in the distant, distant galaxy of Tara B. And our protagonists are King Shan, Queen Anga &amp; their family. King Shan is the emperor of Lengaburu and has been ruling the planet for the last 350 years (they have long lives in Lengaburu, you see!). Letâ€™s write some code to get to know the family

```
A sample usage of shell and its output is shown below

shell > help
 rlist
  \_list available relations
 Person = { member name } ; Relation = { a relation }
  \_find members in the Relation wrt Person
 Person = { member name } ; Relative = { member name }
  \_find Relations of Person wrt Relative
 Father/Mother = { member name } ; Daughter/Son = { new member name }
  \_create a son/daughter to an existing mother / father
 #Daughter = { member name } ;
  \_find max daughter count and member related, wrt member
 bye
  \_exit query session
